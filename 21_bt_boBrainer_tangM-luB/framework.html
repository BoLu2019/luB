    I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us. This union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected. Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world.

    The pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. And in all these ways, they helped make this country more decent and more just. But I'm hopeful because I think there's an awakening taking place in America. There is a young, twenty-three year old white woman named Ashley Baia who organized for our campaign in Florence, South Carolina. That's why I stand here tonight. Words alone cannot meet the needs of our people.

    And so this will be a difficult debate next week. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.

    I wanted to be part of something larger. We can pounce on some gaffe by a Hillary supporter as evidence that she's playing the race card, or we can speculate on whether white men will all flock to John McCain in the general election regardless of his policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    And it's a lesson we need to remember today - as members of another Joshua generation. Like other predominantly black churches across the country, Trinity embodies the black community in its entirety - the doctor and the welfare mom, the model student and the former gang-banger. For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. So let there be no doubt: Islam is a part of America. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not make true democracy. Americans are ready to join with citizens and governments; community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in Muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a better life.
  </p>

  <p>
    That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. That is the true genius of America - a faith in simple dreams,, an insistence on small miracles. That won't keep America safe. Because I've lived it. But I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose.
  </p>

  <p>
    But for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the American Dream, there were many who didn't make it - those who were ultimately defeated, in one way or another, by discrimination. In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically-elected Iranian government.
  </p>

  
  <p>
    We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need. In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. And finally, just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter our principles. The sixth issue that I want to address is women's rights.
  </p>

  <p>   
    The audacity of hope! In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation. Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, "Not this time." This time we want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children and white children and Asian children and Hispanic children and Native American children. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now, some of you may have heard me talk about the Joshua generation. Perhaps somebody told her along the way that the source of her mother's problems were blacks who were on welfare and too lazy to work, or Hispanics who were coming into the country illegally.

    Thank you very much everybody.
